<p>4.1 &nbsp; We will make one attempt to deliver a Consignment during normal working hours. If we cannot obtain a delivery receipt at the Delivery Point you agree that we shall be authorised to attempt to:</p>

<p>4.3&nbsp; If we consider that the Consignment has become a Damaged Consignment and cannot be delivered because it is or in our reasonable opinion is likely to be unsafe hazardous or harmful we reserve the right to dispose of the Damaged Consignment immediately.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp; <b>Sub-Contractors </b></p>

<p>5.1 &nbsp; You agree that we may use another carrier in order to support our provision of the services to you (this will be at our own expense) and you agree that both we and this other carrier shall be entitled to the protection of all of the terms of this Agreement which exclude or limit liability for any losses or damage.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp; <b>Our Liability </b></p>

<p><b>YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THIS CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS OF OUR LIABILITY WITHIN IT. </b></p>

<p>6.1 &nbsp; Where you deal with us as a consumer, nothing within these terms and conditions shall be deemed to affect your rights under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. For the avoidance of any doubt, when you deal with us as a business the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 is hereby excluded to the fullest extent legally possible and you are further referred to additional terms relating to business clients set out below.</p>

<p>6.2 &nbsp; Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude our liability for:</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp; death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</p>

<p>(b) &nbsp; fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

<p>6.3 &nbsp; As a responsible business, we will perform the Service(s) in a professional manner with the appropriate level of skill and care.&nbsp; However, damage to a Consignment may still occur as a consequence of our handling of it and in such circumstances, our liability shall be limited as set out in these Terms and Conditions. The reasoning behind this limitation of our liability is as follows:</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp; The value of a Consignment and the amount of potential loss to you that could arise if a Consignment is damaged or lost is not something which we can easily ascertain but is something which is better known to you.&nbsp; In many cases it cannot be known to us at all and can only be known to you;</p>

<p>(b) &nbsp; The potential amount of loss that might be caused or alleged to be caused to you is likely to be disproportionate to the sum that we could reasonably be expected to charge you for providing the Service(s) under this Agreement;</p>

<p>(c) &nbsp; It is not possible for us to obtain cover which would give unlimited compensation for our full potential liability to all of our customers and, even if it were, such cover would be much cheaper if taken out by you (rather than us taking out such cover and passing the cost on to you) and on that basis, it is more reasonable for you to take out such cover from an independent third party.&nbsp; Please note that you are also able to purchase compensation cover from us for your Consignment during the ordering process;</p>

<p>(d) &nbsp; We wish to keep the costs of providing the Service(s) to you as low as possible;</p>

<p>(e) &nbsp; In light of the above we wish to limit our liability for any damage or loss caused to you to a level which we consider reasonable to our low charges for providing the Services.</p>

<p>(f) &nbsp; In these Terms and Conditions, damage to you means any damage suffered by you (including any loss of, or damage to, a Consignment and any other loss, whether or not known to you or us or in either of our contemplation at the time of entering into this Agreement), however it arises but only so long as it is caused by our negligence, breach of duty or other wrongful act or omission (which includes any deliberately wrongful act or omission) and any breach of any the terms of this Agreement, or any terms implied by statute (where applicable);</p>

<p>(g) &nbsp; We investigate all claims received by us in a fair and speedy manner, but such investigations are more accurate and are easier to perform soon after the loss or damage is alleged to have incurred and on that basis, the timescales set out in this Agreement are necessary to ensure that such investigations can be performed fairly.</p>

<p><i>The Extent of our Liability </i></p>

<p>6.4 &nbsp; <b>We shall only be liable for damage or loss caused to you if it is caused by our negligence, breach of duty or other wrongful act or omission, and only subject to the limitations set out within this clause 6 and clause 7; </b></p>

<p>6.5 &nbsp; <b>We shall not be liable to you under any circumstances for any direct or indirect loss (including, but not limited to loss of profits, or loss of goodwill) or for any other special or indirect losses, costs, damages, or claims which do not arise naturally as a result of our negligence, breach of duty, or other wrongful act or omission. </b></p>

<p>6.6 &nbsp; <b>We shall not be liable to you:</b></p>

<p>a)&nbsp; <b>under any circumstances where there are any material discrepancies (meaning more than 10% difference) between the declared dimensions and weights and the actual dimensions and weights;</b></p>

<p>b)&nbsp; for any damage caused by our negligence, breach of duty, or other wrongful act or omission, which you have, or you have arranged to be, repaired, unless it is agreed by us that the repair work is to be carried out and that a repairer approved by us undertakes this work;</p>

<p><b>c)&nbsp; in any circumstances in respect of the items on the Prohibited items; Special Provisions items and for damage to the No Compensation Items lists, unless otherwise stated by us. </b></p>

<p><i>The Limitation on the Amount of our Liability </i></p>

<p>6.7 &nbsp; If we are liable to you for any reason, we shall (subject always to clause 7) only be liable to refund to you the cost paid for the Service(s), <b>unless you have purchased compensation cover for your Consignment from us</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any compensation cover you may require in respect of any items listed on the &ldquo;Special Provisions&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Compensation Items&rdquo; lists.&nbsp; <b>The items on the &ldquo;Prohibited Items&rdquo; list are prohibited and no level of compensation cover taken out by you will change whether these items will be allowed.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p>Where you purchase compensation cover for your Consignment from us, our liability to you is limited to the value of the compensation cover taken out or the actual value of the Consignment at the date of loss (whichever is the lesser).&nbsp; <b>Where you do not purchase &nbsp;compensation cover, you confirm that you accept the risks of not doing so.</b></p>

<p>We will not be liable to repay you the market value of the Consignment as at the time it was purchased by you. Consignments by their nature are subject to depreciation. <b>You must &nbsp;take out a &ldquo;new for old&rdquo; compensation policy should you wish to be compensated in this way.</b></p>

<p>6.8 &nbsp; In order to ascertain the extent of our liability above, we shall require proof of the value and weight of the entire Consignment and any part or parts of it which make it up and you must ensure that, prior to our collection of the Consignment, you have a record of these. For the avoidance of any doubt, and without affecting clause 6.5, we shall only be liable for the replacement value of the Consignment and not for any sums that would amount to profit on the Consignment or applicable value added tax (or like tax) on such profit.</p>

<p>6.9 &nbsp; If a claim arises as a result of damage to the whole or part of a Consignment and if we settle the claim for a sum equal to or greater than the value of the Consignment, then we shall be entitled to claim ownership of the Consignment and deal with it as we see fit. For the avoidance of any doubt, we shall be responsible for the cost of recovery of the Consignment.</p>

<p>6.10 &nbsp; If you wish to combine a number of discrete packages you must do this within an outer box or packaging fully encompassing each discrete package. If you do not do this and any individual discrete package(s) come apart in transit resulting in one or more of them being lost, then once the remaining parcel(s) are signed for by the recipient, you accept that you cannot make a claim for loss or partial loss of that consignment.</p>

<p><i>No Compensation Items and Special Provisions Items</i></p>

<p>6.11&nbsp; As stated at the beginning of these Terms and Conditions, certain items are carried without compensation cover for damage and at your own risk regardless of whether compensation cover is taken out.&nbsp; A list of these can be found at: <a href="http://www.parcel2go.com/shipping-items.aspx#unins">http://www.parcel2go.com/shipping-items.aspx#unins</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>We do not accept any liability for, damage to or damage caused by any of the items on these lists, whatsoever and howsoever damage is caused, whether in contract, breach of statutory duty, tort (including negligence) or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if compensation cover is taken out for the items on the &ldquo;Special Provisions Items&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;No Compensation Items&rdquo; lists they will be carried with compensation cover only in the event they are lost by us.</p>

<p><i>Special Provisions </i></p>

<p>6.12 &nbsp; (a) &nbsp; We shall not, in any circumstances, be liable to you for any damage caused arising directly or indirectly as a result of any of the Excepted Risks.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp; If at any time we are prevented or delayed from starting, carrying out or completing any of the Services because of a strike, lock out, labour dispute, weather conditions, traffic congestion, mechanical breakdown or obstruction of any public or private road or highway or any other cause beyond our control, you shall have no claim for damages against us for any loss that you may suffer as a result PROVIDED that, where the delay is caused by the mechanical breakdown of one of our vehicles, we shall use our best endeavours to provide a replacement vehicle with the minimum delay practicable.</p>

<p>(c) &nbsp; We shall not in any circumstances be liable for any late delivery or missed delivery or failure to deliver caused by or contributed to by any deficient or ambiguous labelling of a Consignment and you agree to be responsible for ensuring that such labelling is clear and unambiguous.</p>

<p><i>Your Default</i></p>

<p>6.13 &nbsp; If our performance of any of our obligations under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission by you or failure by you to perform any relevant obligation (&ldquo;<b>Your Default</b>&rdquo;):</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp; we shall (without limiting our other rights or remedies) have the right to suspend performance of the Service(s) until you remedy Your Default and, and we shall have the right to rely on Your Default if Your Default prevents or delays our performance of any of our obligations;</p>

<p>(b) &nbsp; we shall not be liable for any costs or losses that you may suffer that arising directly or indirectly from our failure or delay to perform any of our obligations; and</p>

<p>(c) &nbsp; you shall reimburse us on written demand for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by us arising directly or indirectly from Your Default.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp; <b>International Carriage </b></p>

<p>7.1 &nbsp; If we are requested to collect from, or deliver a Consignment to, a country outside of the United Kingdom our terms of liability (subject to clause 7.2 below) shall be governed by the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Contract for International Carriage of Goods by Road as set out in the Schedule to the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965 (as amended) (&ldquo;the CMR Regulations&rdquo;) and, in particular, articles 17 onwards and those provisions shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement and will apply in place of any inconsistent terms within this Agreement. We can provide a copy of these provisions if requested, but even if these are not requested you will be deemed to have read, understood and agreed to them and their incorporation into this Agreement.</p>

<p>7.2 &nbsp; If the carriage of any Consignment occurs by air travel and involves stopping in a country other than the country of departure then the Montreal Convention as amended shall be generally applicable to such part of the carriage as occurs by air and, in particular, our maximum liability in respect of loss of or damage to any such Consignment during air travel shall be limited to the amount set out in the Montreal Convention (namely &pound;1,870 per ton of the gross weight (i.e. including any and all packaging) of the Consignment).</p>

<p>7.3 &nbsp; We shall not be responsible for any local customs charges, import taxes or duties or any similar charge(s) incurred through our carriage and/or delivery of any Consignment and you must satisfy yourself as to whether any of these charges will become due, and if so in what amounts, before completing an order with us. If any such charges become due as a result of our carriage and/or delivery of a Consignment on your behalf and are charged to us by any competent authority you agree to reimburse us fully in respect of the same within 7 days of our demand.</p>

<p>7.4&nbsp; The provisions at clause 8.6 shall apply to this clause 7.</p>

<p>8. &nbsp; <b>Claims and Refunds</b></p>

<p>8.1&nbsp; We shall not be liable to you under any circumstances for any loss or damage unless you notify us either via our website OR by written notice to The Cube, Coe Street, Bolton, BL3 6BU within:</p>

<p>9,&nbsp; <b>Your Indemnity </b></p>

<p>9.1 &nbsp; We shall assume, for the purposes of this Agreement, that you are the sole owner of every item dispatched in the Consignment but if any other person makes a claim against us for loss of or damage to any such items beyond our liability to you then you agree that you shall indemnify us against any losses or liabilities that we suffer through that claim (including all legal costs and expenses) and you agree that we shall have no liability to you in these circumstances, regardless of whether such claims exceed any limitations of liability set out in this Agreement.</p>

<p>10.3 &nbsp; We charge for our Service(s) based on the dimensions and weight of each Consignment.&nbsp; We may check the dimensions and/or weight of each Consignment.&nbsp; In the event we find that the dimensions and/or weight of a Consignment have been under declared by you when checked by us, you agree:</p>

<p>(a)&nbsp; That the dimensions and/or weight that we reasonably determine may be used for the purpose of the &nbsp;calculation of our charges;</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp; We may charge any price difference to you in accordance with our current rates and may also charge an administration fee for correcting such underpayment/additional charge (together, &ldquo;Additional Charges&rdquo;);</p>
